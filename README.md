# Our Services: Get Found. Get Booked.

At **Found First**, we cut out the fluff and focus purely on getting local service businesses (Plumbers, Roofers, HVAC, Auto Repair, Landscaping, and Cleaning Services) higher up on Google so your phone rings with booked jobs. We manage the mess so you can focus on the work.

## 📞 1. Local Map & Call Dominance (Quick Wins)

Your most valuable digital asset is your **Google Business Profile (GBP)**. This is how people find you on Google Maps and in the local search "Map Pack." We manage and optimize this profile to ensure you beat your closest competitors and get more direct calls.

| Deliverable | Benefit to Your Business |
| ----- | ----- |
| **GBP Optimization** | We handle everything: accurate service areas, updated photos, clear business hours, and service descriptions that Google loves. |
| **Review Management** | We implement simple, effective strategies to secure more 5-star reviews and manage any negative feedback professionally, boosting local trust. |
| **Local Citations** | We make sure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are consistent across dozens of high-authority online directories, solidifying your local footprint. |

## 💻 2. Conversion-Ready Website (The Foundation)

A top ranking is worthless if your website breaks when a customer clicks on it. We optimize the *inside* of your website to ensure it loads fast, works flawlessly on a cell phone, and makes it easy for a high-intent user to book a job.

| Deliverable | Benefit to Your Business |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Technical Site Audit** | We fix the hidden errors that scare Google away (slow loading times, broken links, mobile usability issues) so your website is stable and trustworthy. |
| **Service Page Optimization** | We align your key service pages (e.g., "Emergency Water Heater Repair," "Commercial Roofing") with the exact terms local customers are searching for. |
| **Clear Calls-to-Action** | We make sure the **Call Now** button is prominent, easy to tap, and instantly available on every service page to drive conversions. |

## 📈 3. Long-Term Authority & Growth

Once the foundation is solid, we focus on becoming the undisputed authority in your trade for your entire service area. This is the difference between getting a few jobs and keeping your calendar fully booked for months.

| Deliverable | Benefit to Your Business |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Content Strategy** | We identify questions your customers are asking (e.g., "How to prevent ice dams?") and create simple, helpful content that attracts new customers and positions you as the expert. |
| **Authority Building** | We acquire high-quality backlinks from other legitimate local sources (suppliers, community sites, trade associations) to build your site's trust and ranking power. |
| **Performance Reporting** | We translate complex data into simple terms: "You got 52 calls this month from Google Search." We track your revenue-focused **KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators) and timeline expectations. |
